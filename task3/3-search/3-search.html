<H3 CLASS="western">Introduction</H3>
<P>PacMan is hungry but tired. He knows there is food around (he can
smell it), but how can he get to the food as efficiently as possible?
<BR>In this project, we have a simple PacMan environment in which
there are no ghosts and only a single food pellet. Your PacMan agent
will find paths through his maze world to reach a particular location
(where the food is). You will build general search algorithms and
apply them to PacMan scenarios.</P>

</P>

<H3 CLASS="western">Welcome to PacMan 
</H3>
<P>After downloading the code (<A HREF="2-search.zip">2-search.zip</A>),
unzipping it and changing to the <EM>search</EM> directory, you
should be able to play a game of PacMan by typing the following at
the command line: 
</P>
<PRE STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">python pacman.py</PRE>
<P><B>Note:</B> see the information in the python tutorial for how to to use the command-line to execute these files.
Alternatively, you can execute them directly from PyCharm by using the menu option <BR>
<SPAN><CODE>Run-&gt;Run...</CODE></SPAN>
</P>
<P>
PacMan lives in a shiny blue world of twisting corridors and tasty
round treats. Navigating this world efficiently will be PacMan's
first step in mastering his domain. 
</P>
<P>The simplest agent in <A HREF="searchAgents.py">searchAgents.py</A>
is called the <CODE CLASS="western">GoWestAgent</CODE>, which always
goes West (a trivial reflex agent). This agent can only be successful
in very simple and special worlds: 
</P>
<PRE STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">python pacman.py --layout testMaze --pacman GoWestAgent</PRE>
<P>(<B>Note</B>: again this is the command-line way to run this function
with command-line options.  When running from PyCharm you will enter the
options, i.e. the bits after the .py which are: <BR>
“<SPAN><CODE CLASS="western">--layout testMaze --pacman GoWestAgent</CODE></SPAN>” <BR>
in PyCharm's interpreter window as explained in the python tutorial.</P>
<P>But, things already get ugly for this agent when turning is required:
</P>
<PRE STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">python pacman.py --layout tinyMaze --pacman GoWestAgent</PRE>
<P>If pacman gets stuck, you can exit the game by typing CTRL-c into
your terminal. Soon, your agent will solve not only <CODE CLASS="western">tinyMaze</CODE>,
but any maze you want. Note that <CODE CLASS="western"><A HREF="pacman.py">pacman.py</A></CODE>
supports a number of parameters (options) that can each be expressed
in a long way (e.g., <CODE CLASS="western">--layout</CODE>) or a
short way (e.g., <CODE CLASS="western">-l</CODE>). You can see the
list of all options and their default values via: 
</P>
<PRE STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">python pacman.py -h</PRE>
<P>Also, all of the commands that appear in this project also appear in
<A HREF="commands.txt">commands.txt</A>, for easy copying and
pasting. 
</P>
<H3 CLASS="western">Finding a Fixed Food Dot using Search Algorithms 
</H3>
<P>In <CODE CLASS="western"><A HREF="searchAgents.py">searchAgents.py</A></CODE>,
you'll find a fully implemented <CODE CLASS="western">SearchAgent</CODE>,
which plans out a path through PacMan's world and then executes that
path step-by-step. The search algorithms for planning a path are not
implemented -- that's your job. As you work through the following
questions, you might need to refer to this <A HREF="#Glossary">glossary
of objects in the code</A>. First, test that the <CODE CLASS="western">SearchAgent</CODE>
is working correctly by running: 
</P>
<PRE STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">python pacman.py -l tinyMaze -p SearchAgent -a fn=tinyMazeSearch</PRE><P>
The command above tells the <CODE CLASS="western">SearchAgent</CODE>
to use <CODE CLASS="western">tinyMazeSearch</CODE> as its search
algorithm, which is implemented in <CODE CLASS="western"><A HREF="search.py">search.py</A></CODE>.
PacMan should navigate the maze successfully. 
</P>
<P>Now it's time to write full-fledged generic search functions to
help PacMan plan routes! Pseudocode for the search algorithms you'll
write can be found in the lecture slides and Poole&amp;Mackworth.
Remember that a search node must contain not only a state but also
the information necessary to reconstruct the path (plan) which gets
to that state. 
</P>
<P><EM>Important note:</EM> All of your search functions need to
return a list of <EM>actions</EM> that will lead the agent from the
start to the goal. These actions all have to be legal moves (valid
directions, no moving through walls). 
</P>
<P><EM>Hint:</EM> Each algorithm is very similar. Algorithms for DFS,
BFS, UCS and A* differ only in the details of how the fringe is
managed. So, concentrate on getting DFS right and the rest should be
relatively straightforward. Indeed, one possible implementation
requires only a single generic search method which is configured with
an algorithm-specific queuing strategy (but your implementation need
<EM>not</EM> be of this form to receive full credit). 
</P>
<P><EM>Hint:</EM> Make sure to check out the <CODE CLASS="western">Stack,
Queue</CODE> and <CODE CLASS="western">PriorityQueue</CODE> types
provided to you in <CODE CLASS="western"><A HREF="util.py">util.py</A></CODE>!
</P>
<P><EM><STRONG>Assignment 1 </STRONG></EM>Implement the depth-first
search (DFS) algorithm in the <CODE CLASS="western">depthFirstSearch</CODE>
function in <CODE CLASS="western"><A HREF="search.py">search.py</A></CODE>.
To make your algorithm <EM>complete</EM>, write the graph search
version of DFS, which avoids expanding any already visited states
(P&amp;M section 3.7.1). 
</P>
<P>Your code should quickly find a solution for: 
</P>
<PRE STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">python pacman.py -l tinyMaze -p SearchAgent
python pacman.py -l mediumMaze -p SearchAgent
python pacman.py -l bigMaze -z .5 -p SearchAgent</PRE><P>
The PacMan board will show an overlay of the states explored, and the
order in which they were explored (brighter red means earlier
exploration). Is the exploration order what you would have expected?
Does PacMan actually go to all the explored squares on his way to the
goal? 
</P>
<P><EM>Hint:</EM> If you use a <CODE CLASS="western">Stack</CODE> as
your data structure, the solution found by your DFS algorithm for
<CODE CLASS="western">mediumMaze</CODE> should have a length of 130
(provided you push successors onto the fringe in the order provided
by getSuccessors; you might get 244 if you push them in the reverse
order). Is this a least cost solution? If not, think about what
depth-first search is doing wrong. 
</P>
<P><EM><STRONG>Assignment 2 </STRONG></EM>Implement the breadth-first
search (BFS) algorithm in the <CODE CLASS="western">breadthFirstSearch</CODE>
function in <CODE CLASS="western"><A HREF="search.py">search.py</A></CODE>.
Again, write a graph search algorithm that avoids expanding any
already visited states. Test your code the same way you did for
depth-first search. 
</P>
<PRE STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">python pacman.py -l mediumMaze -p SearchAgent -a fn=bfs
python pacman.py -l bigMaze -p SearchAgent -a fn=bfs -z .5</PRE><P>
Does BFS find a least cost solution? If not, check your
implementation. 
</P>
<P><EM>Hint:</EM> If PacMan moves too slowly for you, try the option
<CODE CLASS="western">--frameTime 0</CODE>. 
</P>
<P><EM>Note:</EM> If you've written your search code generically,
your code should work equally well for the eight-puzzle search
problem without any changes. 
</P>
<PRE STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">python eightpuzzle.py</PRE>

<h3 class="western">Run configuration arguments</h3>

<p>
Tired of entering the command line arguments (like 'bigMaze -p SearchAgent -a fn=bfs -z .5') over and over again?
There is an easier, faster way to do this. We can tell PyCharm to always run our program with these arguments.
</p>

<p>
To do this, go to the menu at the top; 'Run -> Edit Configurations...'. The settings for the current default
configuration (which is run when you click the green arrow) are shown. In the 'Script parameters' field, enter the arguments
you like (without 'python pacman.py').
</p>

<p>
Now, each time you hit the green arrow button, or the debug button, the arguments will automatically be entered.
Don't forget to change the arguments when you get to another part of the assignment!
</p>

<H3 CLASS="western">
Varying the Cost Function 
</H3>
<P>While BFS will find a fewest-actions path to the goal, we might
want to find paths that are &quot;best&quot; in other senses.
Consider <CODE CLASS="western"><A HREF="layouts/mediumDottedMaze.lay">mediumDottedMaze</A></CODE>
and <CODE CLASS="western"><A HREF="layouts/mediumScaryMaze.lay">mediumScaryMaze</A></CODE>.
By changing the cost function, we can encourage PacMan to find
different paths. For example, we can charge more for dangerous steps
in ghost-ridden areas or less for steps in food-rich areas, and a
rational PacMan agent should adjust its behavior in response. 
</P>
<P><EM><STRONG>Assignment 3 </STRONG></EM>Implement the uniform-cost
graph search algorithm in the <CODE CLASS="western">uniformCostSearch</CODE>
function in <CODE CLASS="western"><A HREF="search.py">search.py</A></CODE>.
We encourage you to look through <CODE CLASS="western"><A HREF="util.py">util.py</A></CODE>
for some data structures that may be useful in your implementation.
You should now observe successful behavior in all three of the
following layouts, where the agents below are all UCS agents that
differ only in the cost function they use (the agents and cost
functions are written for you): 
</P>
<PRE STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">python pacman.py -l mediumMaze -p SearchAgent -a fn=ucs
python pacman.py -l mediumDottedMaze -p StayEastSearchAgent
python pacman.py -l mediumScaryMaze -p StayWestSearchAgent</PRE><P>
<EM>Note:</EM> You should get very low and very high path costs for
the <CODE CLASS="western">StayEastSearchAgent</CODE> and
<CODE CLASS="western">StayWestSearchAgent</CODE> respectively, due to
their exponential cost functions (see <CODE CLASS="western"><A HREF="searchAgents.py">searchAgents.py</A></CODE>
for details). 
</P>
<H3 CLASS="western">A* search 
</H3>
<P><EM><STRONG>Assignment 4 </STRONG></EM>Implement A* graph search
in the empty function <CODE CLASS="western">aStarSearch</CODE> in
<CODE CLASS="western"><A HREF="search.py">search.py</A></CODE>.
A* takes a heuristic function as an argument. Heuristics take two
arguments: a state in the search problem (the main argument), and the
problem itself (for reference information). The <CODE CLASS="western">nullHeuristic</CODE>
heuristic function in <CODE CLASS="western"><A HREF="search.py">search.py</A></CODE>
is a trivial example. 
</P>
<P>You can test your A* implementation on the original problem of
finding a path through a maze to a fixed position using the Manhattan
distance heuristic (implemented already as <CODE CLASS="western">manhattanHeuristic</CODE>
in <CODE CLASS="western"><A HREF="searchAgents.py">searchAgents.py</A></CODE>).
</P>
<PRE STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">python pacman.py -l bigMaze -z .5 -p SearchAgent -a fn=astar,heuristic=manhattanHeuristic </PRE><P>
You should see that A* finds the optimal solution slightly faster
than uniform cost search (about 549 vs. 620 search nodes expanded in
our implementation, but ties in priority may make your numbers differ
slightly). What happens on <CODE CLASS="western">openMaze</CODE> for
the various search strategies? 
</P>
<P>The real power of A* will only be apparent with more challenging
search problems, in particular when more than one goal (i.e, food
pellet) has to be reached. That will be the topic for next week's
practical sessions. 
</P>
<H3 CLASS="western">BONUS: Changing the representation 
</H3>
<P>The PacMan world is full of corridors. Clearly it's stupid for
PacMan to go partway down a corridor and then turn around (when there
are no ghosts). However, the search methods used so far all check if
turning around is a reasonable option after every step down the
corridor (even if the cycle avoidance mechanism ensures that they do
not actually do turn around). Potentially, a lot of effort can be
saved by re-representing the problem in such a way that a single
action is moving the whole way down a corridor rather than just
moving one cell onwards. Replacing a sequence of actions by a single
action in this way is a form of problem abstraction, which is
commonly used to speed up search - in particular in computer games,
where the graph of cross-roads and moves between them is called the
<EM>waypoint graph</EM>. See e.g.
<A HREF="http://www.aiwisdom.com/ai_pathfinding.html">www.aiwisdom.com/ai_pathfinding.html
</A>
</P>
<P><EM><STRONG>Extra Credit Assignment </STRONG></EM>Implement the
missing code in the <CODE CLASS="western">CrossroadSearchAgent</CODE>
in <CODE CLASS="western"><A HREF="searchAgents.py">searchAgents.py</A></CODE>,
so that one action is a move between crossroads in the map (i.e.
points where PacMan has more than 2 legal moves available).
